NullBot
=======

NullBot - an adaptive Skirmish AI for Warzone 2100 open-source realtime strategy game is hosted here after being rewritten from scratch as "NullBot 3". Older versions of NullBot are still hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/nullbot2100/

Unlike NullBot 1.x or 2.x, NullBot 3.x doesn't have any build system; you can just throw the files in this repository to /multiplay/skirmish/, select the AI in the game menu and play and it'll work.

You can download a release of this AI that is considered to be "the most stable", and also discuss the AI and report bugs, in the official NullBot3 thread at http://forums.wz2100.net/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=10619

All releases are marked with git tags in this repository.

This AI requires Warzone 2100 v3.2 or higher to work. Unless a time machine has been invented, this means that you'd need to get a nightly development snapshot of the game's master version at http://buildbot.wz2100.net/files/ Please use the actually-latest snapshot, because a lot of work is currently being done on the scripting system.
